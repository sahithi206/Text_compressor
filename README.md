Text Compressor using Huffman Coding
This project implements a text compression algorithm using Huffman coding.Huffman coding is a popular method for lossless data compression, which assigns variable-length codes to input characters,with shorter codes assigned to more frequent characters.

Features
Compress text files using Huffman coding
Decompress the compressed files back to their original form
Efficient encoding and decoding processes
Tech Stack
Programming Language: C++
Compiler: g++
Version Control: Git
Installation
Clone the repository: bash git clone https://github.com/sahithi206/Text_compressor_Huffman_coding.git cd Text_compressor_Huffman_coding

Ensure you have a C++ compiler installed. For example, you can install g++ if it's not already installed: bash sudo apt-get install g++

Compile the project: bash g++ project.cpp -o text_compressor

File Descriptions
project.cpp: The main C++ source file containing the implementation of the compressor and decompressor.
input.txt: Sample input text file.
output.txt: Sample output file after compression or decompression.
Usage
Compress a file: bash ./text_compressor input.txt output.txt

Decompress a file: bash ./text_compressor -d output.txt decompressed.txt
